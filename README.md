# The Practice of Ruby @ OCTanner

This is how we work and live our craft.

## Code Reviews

> We use Github Pull Requests to drive face-to-face code reviews. Everyone should have equal authority to approve or recommend changes to a pull request.

We believe that code reviews are an essential tool for keeping code quality high. Everything we do gets code reviewed. We use Github, and have pull requests be the only way that code gets into our repository. We have a more detailed document showing all of the steps of our code reviews, but the essentials include a face-to-face review of the code, and an expectation that we will discuss both style and approach, in addition to syntax, structure, and other mechanics.

## Coding Style

> We follow Ruby community style guide for Ruby code, and our [O.C. Tanner Style guide for Ruby code](./style-guide.md). Any deviations are specified in our style guide amendments.

We believe the best way to keep code readable among a team is to establish a us set coding style. Obviously such a style will involve compromises, but the outcome is worth the effort when everybody can read code written by others.

## Testing

> We use Quick and Nimble, and take a BDD approach to unit testing. We use RSpec as our standard unit testing framework.

We believe testing is an essential tool for developing reliable code and keeping it in shape to allow for confidently making changes to our code in the future.

## Learning

> We do on-the-job learning.

We believe that each of us has room to grow, and that taking time to learn is essential to providing our employer with the very best quality code.

## Community

> We participate in the Ruby community by both learning and giving back to it.

We believe that in being a strong part of our local community, we help lift all of us in our desire to be the best programmers we can be.
