# Testing

#### Unit Testing

> We use [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) as our standard unit testing framework.

We believe testing is an essential tool for developing reliable code and keeping it in shape to allow for confidently making changes to our code in the future.

#### Code Coverage

> We use [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) as our standard code coverage framework.

While we do not feel code coverage reflects the quality of tests, it does let us know when we stop writing them.

Code coverage can be an over used metric.  Therefore we believe in just setting a percentage and ensuring the coverage never drops below that.
