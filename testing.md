# Testing

#### Unit Testing

> We believe that testing is valuable and important. It lets us have confidence in our code and helps move us to Continuous Delivery.
> We use RSpec as our standard unit testing framework.

>  While we do not feel code coverage reflects the quality of tests, it does let us know when we stop writing them.

We believe testing is an essential tool for developing reliable code and keeping it in shape to allow for confidently making changes to our code in the future.
Code coverage can be an over used metric.  Therefore we believe in just setting a percentage and ensuring the coverage never drops below that.
